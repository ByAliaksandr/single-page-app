# SinglePageApp

This project is a single page app with a sign-up form.

## About the project

_Note_ This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.7.
Angular CLI provides the default configuration to run unit tests. Angular CLI doesn't provide end-to-end testing capabilities by default.

The project relies on [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) and [Bootstrap Grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/). Angular Material provides a set of reusable and accessible UI components. Angular Material perfectly fits for projects with forms which require various validation scenarios.

The project employs [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) with a pre-commit hook. This makes sure all your commits are formatted.

The project uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) as an end-to-end testing framework.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
